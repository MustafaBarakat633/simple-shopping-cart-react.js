# Simple Shopping Cart - React.js

I'm currently learning React.js and following [Maximilian Schwarzmüller React course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wby/) specifically.

There is a section in the course about **React Context** that solves **Prop Drilling** problem. I challenged myself to implement the project before using React Context and of course with the prop drilling problem. This is the purpose of this section basically, to know the problem and solve it.The project is a very simple online store with dummy data and this is the result.
